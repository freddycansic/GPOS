projection matrix = map world coords to screen coords
convert vertex coordinates to noramlised device coordinates
normalised space = coordinate system of -1 to 1 in x y and z
perspective matrix = vertices with a smaller z value (further away) = closer to middle of screen = looks smaller

orthographic projection = 2d side scroller, ui overlay
perspective projection = fps

view matrix
aka eye matrix
"the view of the camera"
way to simulate camera 
position, rotation(orientataion) scale of camera
camera movements = do the inverse to vertex 
e.g moving camera left 100 units = move everything else 100 units right

model matrix
transformation of model
= translation rotation scale


mvp matrix = model view proj matrix
